# Auto-MLA-8-Formatter
This auto formatter is intended to automatically put in a heading in the MLA 8 format with the current date. The auto editor will NOT automatically update the date - that is YOUR responsibility. Please note that sometimes you may have to change the line spacing or font size based on teacher requirements.

This is meant to be used in Google Docs, using the Script Editor

Copy the text in the HTML and paste it into the Script editor.
Follow the instructions at the top of the code, and you should be good to go!
